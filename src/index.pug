            p Hi, I'm Jason. I'm a classically trained <strong>computer scientist</strong> with a focus on the <strong>front end</strong>. I like to work closely with designers, product managers and engineers to build the best possible <strong>user experience</strong>.
            p Whatever role I’m playing, whatever task I’m doing, I never lose sight of the needs of the <strong>end user</strong>. I take the <strong>quality of the products</strong> I make seriously because I always want to make people’s day a little better rather than a little worse. I take the <strong>code quality</strong> seriously because its users (other engineers and my future self) should have a pleasant experience too.
            p The focus on the user is what lead me to <strong>prototyping</strong> as a primary activity. It allows us to answer more UX questions sooner in the cycle, which leads to better specs and better chances that what we go build in production is what the user truly needs.
            p I have had the privilege to be a <strong>team leader</strong> on several occasions. It is both the hardest and most rewarding thing I’ve done in my professional life. The adrenaline rush that comes from shipping a feature is nothing compared to the quiet satisfaction of seeing someone I mentored <strong>continue to succeed</strong> years down the road.
            p At Kareo I built a great little engineering team under the umbrella of the Design org. This counterintuitive structure is becoming less rare. I’ve seen Google referred to this as <em>UX Engineer, Design</em>, though we called simply <em>UX Prototyper</em>.
            p Prior to Kareo I worked as a <strong>full stack</strong> engineer at Energysavvy (energy efficiency), Redfin (real estate) and Treemo (social media). Though for a time at Redfin I filled a role that I’d now call <em>UX Engineer</em> as well. When I was at Lucent I worked on all sorts of arcane technology, and visual basic.
            p I relocated to Chicago in 2016; but I'm an old hand at working remote. When I’m not working I’m  taking photographs, hanging out with my cats, watching a cubs game, or just exploring this new city I call home.
